## Inheriting and Enhancing

My portfolio site began as a bootstrap project, inheriting elements from an existing codebase. This provided a solid foundation as I ventured into refining and expanding its features. Inspired by the Cyberpunk aesthetic of the 80s and 90s, I integrated bold katakana lettering and a text decoding effect, paying homage to iconic movies like Ghost in the Shell, The Matrix, and Akira.

## The Evolution

As my skills progressed, I transformed the site into a dynamic playground for experimentation. I transitioned from static mockups to real-time rendered interactive 3D devices using models created for the [Clay Mockups 3D Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/819335598581469537/Clay-Mockups-3D).

## Migrating to Next.js

Seeking to enhance the site further, I migrated to Next.js. This decision was driven by its suitability for my evolving needs. Notable changes include:

- Adoption of Next.js, replacing Create React App, providing a more tailored environment.
- Transitioning to vanilla CSS with postcss for future CSS features, employing CSS modules for enhanced styling.
- Utilizing Kent C Dodds' [mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) for efficient generation of pages from `.mdx` files.
- Shifting from Tween.js and React Transition Group to Framer Motion for streamlined animations.
- Elevating 3D effects with Three.js, incorporating `three-stdlib` for better module maintenance.

## Navigating Challenges

While the migration presented its challenges, such as animated route transitions and scroll restoration issues, innovative solutions were implemented.

## Reflecting and Looking Forward

As I continue to use this site as a creative playground, I eagerly anticipate the next phase of its evolution, comparing it to the progress made thus far.
