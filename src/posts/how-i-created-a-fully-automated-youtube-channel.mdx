title: From Manual to Magical - How I Created a Fully Automated YouTube Channel
abstract: I developed a fully automated solution to manage a YouTube channel effortlessly. By utilizing tools like insta loader, insta looter, ffmpeg, and moviepy, I created a software system that automates tasks such as Instagram login, reel downloads, video compilation, watermarking, Google login, and YouTube uploads using the v3 API. The software operates on a 24-hour cycle, ensuring consistent content delivery. Through this project, I successfully demonstrated my ability to leverage automation to enhance productivity, streamline content creation, and prioritize creative engagement with the audience 🔉.

# Introduction

Hey LinkedIn fam! 👋 Have you ever wondered how to turn your YouTube channel into an unstoppable content machine? 🤔 Well, get ready to have your mind blown because today, I'm here to spill the secrets on how I transformed a channel from manual madness to complete automation! 🤖💥

My YouTube automation project in github has 9 active forks 🚀

Here's the projct source code as I promised in LinkedIn 🔗github.com/gd03champ/YouTube-Automation

# The Need for Automation in YouTube Channel Management

Let's face it, managing a YouTube channel manually is a full-time job on its own! 🕒😫 From logging in to Instagram to downloading reels, compiling videos, applying watermarks, logging in to Google, and uploading to YouTube - it's a never-ending cycle of repetitive tasks! 😩 But fear not, because automation is here to save the day! 🦸 ♂️💪

# Creating the Automation Software

Now, let me spill the secret and walk you through the functionalities of the software I cooked up! 🍲👨 🍳

## Automating Instagram Interaction

To kick things off, my software automagically logs into Instagram, leaving no room for FOMO! 😎 It swiftly downloads all the juicy reels posted within the last 24 hours from the accounts I follow, ensuring I'm up to date with the latest trends and viral content. 🕺📲

Here's a gist 👇

```python
def scrapeVideos(username = "",
                 password = "",
                 output_folder = "",
                 days = 1):

    print("Starting Scraping")


    L = instaloader.Instaloader()


    # Login or load session for loader
    L.login(username, password)
    profile = instaloader.Profile.from_username(L.context, username)
    following = profile.get_followees()
    print(following)


    today = datetime.date.today()
    timeframe = (today, today - dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta(days=days))


    for profile in following:
        acc = profile.username
        looter = ProfileLooter(acc, videos_only=True, template="{id}-{username}-{width}-{height}")
        if not looter.logged_in():
            looter.login(username, password)
        print("Scraping From Account: " + acc)
        try:
            numDowloaded = looter.download(output_folder, media_count=30, timeframe=timeframe)
            print("Downloaded " + str(numDowloaded) + " videos successfully")
            print("")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Skipped acc " + acc + "because of");
            print(e);
```

## Compiling Videos and Applying Watermark

Next, my software puts on its director's hat and creates epic video compilations according to the given configuration. 🎥🎬 It seamlessly stitches together the downloaded reels, adding a touch of personalization with an automatic watermark. Now, no one can steal my precious content! 🚫👀

Here's the snipper of compilation 👇

```python
def makeCompilation(path = "./
                    introName = '',
                    outroName = '',
                    totalVidLength = 10*60,
                    maxClipLength = 20,
                    minClipLength = 5,
                    outputFile = "output.mp4"):


    allVideos = []
    seenLengths = defaultdict(list)
    totalLength = 0
    for fileName in os.listdir(path):

        filePath = join(path, fileName);
        if isfile(filePath) and fileName.endswith(".mp4"):
            print(fileName)
            if os.stat(filePath).st_size < 5000:
                continue


            # Destination path
            clip = VideoFileClip(filePath)
            clip = clip.resize(width=1920)
            clip = clip.resize(height=1080)
            duration = clip.duration
            print(duration)
            if duration <= maxClipLength and duration >= minClipLength:
                allVideos.append(clip)
                seenLengths[duration].append(fileName)
                totalLength += duration

    print("Total Length: " + str(totalLength))


    random.shuffle(allVideos)


    duration = 0
    # Add intro vid
    videos = []
    if introName != '':
        introVid = VideoFileClip("./" + introName)
        videos.append(introVid)
        duration += introVid.duration

    description = ""
    # Create videos
    for clip in allVideos:
        timeRange = generateTimeRange(duration, clip.duration)
        acc = extractAcc(clip.filename)
        description += timeRange + " : @" + acc + "\n"
        duration += clip.duration
        videos.append(clip)
        print(duration)
        if duration >= totalVidLength:
            # Just make one video
            break

    # Add outro vid
    if outroName != '':
        outroVid = VideoFileClip("./" + outroName)
        videos.append(outroVid)


    finalClip = concatenate_videoclips(videos, method="compose")


    audio_path = "/tmp/temoaudiofile.m4a"


    #print(description)
    # Create compilation
    finalClip.write_videofile(outputFile, threads=8, temp_audiofile=audio_path, remove_temp=True, codec="libx264", audio_codec="aac")


    return description,"
```

## Seamless YouTube Uploads

Once the video masterpiece is complete, it's time for the grand finale! 🌟🎉 My software performs a dazzling dance routine by logging into Google and effortlessly uploads the video to YouTube using the v3 API. The audience won't even know it wasn't my own two hands doing the work! 🤫💻📤

Here's the code that does the uploading job for us👇

```python
from googleapiclient.http import MediaFileUpload

def uploadYtvid(VIDEO_FILE_NAME='',
                title='Intro Video!',
                description=':) ',
                tags=[],
                googleAPI=None):

    now = datetime.datetime.now()
    upload_date_time = datetime.datetime(now.year, now.month, now.day, now.hour, now.minute, int(now.second)).isoformat() + '.000Z'


    request_body = {
        'snippet': {
            'categoryId': 23,
            'title': title,
            'description': description,
            'tags': tags
        },
        'status': {
            'privacyStatus': 'public',
            'selfDeclaredMadeForKids': False,
        },
        'notifySubscribers': False
    }

    mediaFile = MediaFileUpload(VIDEO_FILE_NAME, chunksize=-1, resumable=True)

    response_upload = googleAPI.videos().insert(
        part='snippet,status',
        body=request_body,
        media_body=mediaFile
    ).execute()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uploadYtvid(VIDEO_FILE_NAME='./intro_vid.mp4')
```

## Automating the 24-Hour Cycle

But wait, the magic doesn't stop there! 🎩✨ My software knows that content creation never sleeps, so it repeats the entire process every 24 hours, ensuring my channel stays as fresh as a just-baked batch of cookies! 🍪🔄

## Benefits and Impact of Complete Automation

Oh, the wonders of automation! 🌟🌈 By embracing the power of complete automation, the YouTube channel has gone from being a time-consuming chore to a well-oiled content machine! 🤖⚙️ The benefits are endless - increased productivity, consistent content delivery, and more time to focus on creative ideas and audience engagement. 🚀🎨💬

# Challenges and Lessons Learned

Now, let's not forget the behind-the-scenes bloopers and the lessons learned along the way! 🎬 Building this automated YouTube channel wasn't a walk in the park. There were moments when my software misbehaved and glitches turned my content into a comedy show! 😅.

Also getting approval for the YouTube API access from Google wasn't a easy process, untill then, the videos would be locked in private mode🔏. But hey, I learned to expect the unexpected and developed resilience in the face of technical challenges. 💪💡

# Conclusion

✨ With a little bit of code, some ingenious tools like insta loader, insta looter, ffmpeg, and moviepy, and a sprinkle of automation, I've achieved the holy bread of YouTube content creation - a fully automated channel! 🎥🤖 Now, we can sit back, relax, and watch the content conquer the YouTube universe seamlessly🍹.
